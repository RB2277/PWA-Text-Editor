 # PWA-Text-Editor

## Description
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This app features a text editor that runs within the browser, and additionally allows the app to be downloaded via PWA (Progressive Web Applications). The front-end code was provided to me, and I was tasked with ensuring the app is able to be downloaded properly, and that the PWA is setup correctly. Another feature the app contains is the ability to run while offline, and have data persist through the downloaded version and web version of the app.
